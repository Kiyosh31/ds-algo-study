# Overview

It is called `depth` because goes from top to bottom, it can go to the left or to the right that depends on the algorithm used.

This `traversing algorithm` has the criteria of `visiting order` this order is marked by `preorder`, `inorder`, `postorder` which the criteria changed a little bit different in each of them.

## Preorder

> Visit order: value -> left -> right

## Inorder

> Visit order: left -> value -> right

## Postorder

> Visit order: left -> right -> value

# Big(O)

This applies for all of the algorithms described above

| Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
