# Overview

This is usally a `brute force` algorithm since this test all possible paths, well this algorthm consists on visitting all paths to determine which one is the best for our current needs, it is recursive check a path and if its the right one goes deeper until it finds the solution and then goes up returning `true if the path is correct` or `false if the path is wrong`
