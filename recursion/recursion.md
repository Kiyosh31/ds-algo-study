# Introduction

Factorial is all about `subproblems` this means we take a big problem and made it a slightly smaller problem

# How do they look? (Structure)

Recursive have 2 parts:

1. The base case
2. The function calling itself with a different input

There are two types of recursion `one-branch` and `two-branch`

## One-Branch

> example: Factorial of a number

## Two-Branch
